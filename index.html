        <div id="about-info">
            <p>I am an Iowa State University student who is studying Electrical Engineering. 
                I am a life long learner who spends a lot of time trying out all of the amazing things 
                I learn in my classes! My interest currently resides in control systems and embedded systems, but I 
                really do enjoy it all. Currently I am working for Vermeer Corporation as an embedded software
                engineering intern.

                    <p>In this project, the goal was to create a simulated handheld calculator that could do basic
                         math functions like addition, subtraction, and multiplication using Verilog, Quartus Prime,
                          and Questa Modelsim to program Iowa State's Altera DE2-115 Cyclone IV FPGA Board. I worked on 
                          this project independently and gained a lot of experience dealing with time management and 
                          project deadlines. For this project to come together, I had to learn a lot about Verilog coding 
                          and Quartus Prime logic design; along with these skills I developed, I also learned how to more 
                          accurately troubleshoot the hidden issues that come up in large designs like this one. This was a 
                          very fun project that taught me a lot about the engineering process, I am thankful I got to work 
                          on something that is very commonly used in the real world; it gave me a new appreciation for 
                          something that I had taken for granted before.

                    Active Crossover Network Project

                    <p>For this project, the goal was to create an active 3-way crossover network, 
                        similar to what you would see in a basic speaker system today. Using basic 
                        operational amplifier configurations and calculations, my partner and I took 
                        one audio signal and split it into 3-parts: a tweeter, a squawker, and a subwoofer, 
                        each with different ranges of frequency that were all sourced from the original audio. 
                        This project not only helped me develop my teamwork and leadership skills, but it also
                         taught me a lot about dealing with systems that are built with non-ideal circuit 
                         elements. Lots of calculations came close to the values required, but some were not
                          there and required some tweaking from my partner and me. This lab helped give me 
                          confidence in my understanding of frequency response and filter design using software 
                          like LTSpice and Matlab.
